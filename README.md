# Doubly linked list in C

This is a simple program to implement a doubly linked list in C. The node structure uses unsigned char for its internal data type. 

## What This Is

This is an easy to understand implementation of a Linked list data structure. 

### Running

Unix users proceed with the following commands in your terminal: 

```
$ ./run.sh -c
```

Windows users will need to compile themselves. Simply run the executable after compilation.

### Manifest


```
makefile
```
Compilation instructions for users machines. 


```
run.sh
```

setup utility for linux users. 

```
driver.c
```
where user can modify and play around with the list structure using their own data.

```
list.c
```

Main c code portion, definitions, implementations etc.

```
list.h
```

decrarations of functions as well as the node struct.
